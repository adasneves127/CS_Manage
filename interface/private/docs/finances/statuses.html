            <h1>Finance Statuses</h1>
            Financial Statuses are the method to control what stage a financial record is in the process of payment.
            <br>
            The statuses given by the system on creation are:
            <ul>
                <li>Pending &mdash; Used when the record has been created, but not debated or approved by either the Officers or the Student Government Financial Committee.</li>
                <li>Granted &mdash; Used only for Budget records, used to indicate that the budget request has been approved by the club.</li>
                <li>Denied &mdash; Used when the financial record has been denied by the Finance Committee, or denied by a vote of the officers.</li>
                <li>Open &mdash; Used when an <code>Invoice</code> or <code>Credit</code> type record is awaiting payment.</li>
                <li>Paid &mdash; Used when an <code>Invoice</code> type record has been paid, but confirmation of the items requested has not been received.</li>
                <li>Closed &mdash; Used when a finance record has been paid <b>and</b> confirmation of the goods has been received, or all available funds from the budget have been used.</li>
                <li>Cancelled &mdash; Used when an approved finance record needs to be rescinded.</li>
            </ul>
            This system allows Finance Administrators to modify the statuses available in the system. To do so, use the navbar on the application pages, and go to <code>Admin</code> -> <code>Finance Statuses</code>.
            <br>
            This page allows you to edit and create new Finance Statuses. Please note, editing a finance status will result in all records which referenced that status, updating to the new status description. <br>

            Updating the <code>Pending</code> status is also not recomended, as some system-automated processes are driven off of this status (Such as creation of a Docket Item on Finance Creation). <br>
            The system will also default to the <code>Pending</code> status for new records for non-finance admin users. If the user is a Finance Admin, then they can set the status to any existing status in the system.
